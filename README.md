# heterogeneous_synaptic_homeostasis
This GitHub repository includes scripts for implementing heterogeneous synaptic homeostasis, a novel synaptic mechanism aimed at elucidating shifts in the propagation pattern of information across the cortex during the sleep-wake cycle, detailed in [doi:10.1101/2023.12.04.569905](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.04.569905v1).
